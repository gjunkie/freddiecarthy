          Hi, I&apos;m Freddie. I live in Portland, OR with my wife and two amazing kids. We&apos;re originally from Southern California and moved up here in 2014. We absolutely love it!

        <p>
          I&apos;ve been working as a software engineer since about 2010 but engineering was actually the last of several callings I had. I went to school at San Francisco State University (go Gators!) with a major in Television Broadcasting. I really wanted to be an editor, but figured that out a bit late. By the time I did I was close to being done with school! Fast forward a couple of years and countless hours learning frontend development and I landed my first job at a start up in Santa Monica, CA.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve lived in quite a few places, and I consider myself &quot;from&quot; a few of those. I was born in Los Angeles, CA, but grew up in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.
