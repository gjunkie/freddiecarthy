          Hi, I&apos;m Freddie. I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer at Twitter. I&apos;ve been working in the industry since ~2010. I&apos;m currently living in Portland, OR with my wife and two amazing kids. We absolutely love it here!
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve lived in quite a few places, and I consider myself &quot;from&quot; a few of those. I was born in Los Angeles, CA, but grew up in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.
