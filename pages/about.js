          Hi, I&apos;m Freddie. I live in Portland, OR with my wife and two amazing kids. We&apos;re originally from Southern California and moved up here in 2014. We absolutely love it!
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve been working as a Software Engineer since about 2010 but engineering was actually the last of several callings I had. I went to school at San Francisco State University (go Gators!) where I majored in Television Broadcasting. Before that I was on my way to be a firefighter. Fast forward a couple of years, and countless hours learning frontend development, and I landed my first job at a start up in Santa Monica, CA.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve lived in quite a few places, and I consider myself &quot;from&quot; a few of those. I was born in Los Angeles, CA, but grew up in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina before moving <i>back</i> to LA.
