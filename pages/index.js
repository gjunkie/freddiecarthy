          Some hot takes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn web fundamentals, not just <code>create-react-app</code> or Webpack configs. 💻</li>
          <li>Assumptions are meant to be challenged, particularly your own. 🧠</li>
          <li>If you put cream and sugar in your coffee you don&apos;t like coffee. ☕️</li>
        </ul>
