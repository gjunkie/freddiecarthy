          Hi, I&apos;m Freddie. I&apos;m a human living in the Pacific Northwest with my wife and two amazing kids. I&apos;ve been working as a Software Engineer since 2010. <strong>I&apos;m currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Twitter</strong> with a focus on frontend engineering. Previously I&apos;ve worked at Discovery Networks, Nike, and Opal Labs.

          Some hot takes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn web fundamentals, not just <code>create-react-app</code>. üíª</li>
          <li>Challenge assumptions, including your own. üß†</li>
          <li>Coffee is meant to be had black. ‚òïÔ∏è</li>
          <li>I don&apos;t tolerare intolerance. ‚úä</li>

              2020 was the fucking worst, but it <i>did</i> teach me quite bit about what I find most valuable. This is my open farewell to the worst year ever.

            <p>
              I&apos;ve been a Vim user since the day I started working in this industry. Since then I&apos;ve learned a thing or two and made myself a pretty sweet setup. <a href="https://github.com/gjunkie/dotfiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check out my dotfiles</a> for a one-line install of all my settings, apps, and tooling that I use. I update it regularly.
