It is less a story and more a personal account of a biologistâ€™s experiences once she enters what is known as Area X. A mysterious coastal territory, Area X is the epicenter of some great natural calamity"

I was recently looking into learning more about algorithms. One GitHub repo led to another and I instead ended up learning about some simple ciphers used throughout human history. I decided to use this blog post as a way to learn more about them and show some interactive examples.

### Ceasar Cipher
The first one was the Ceasar cipher, named after, and allegedly used by, the Roman general. The cipher is is one of the simplest ones, where every letter is offset by the same pre-defined number of letters in the alphabet. So if your offset is -3, the letter D would become the letter A. Ceasar allegedly used this type of encryption and is often attributed to helping him in battle.

While this may have been a suitable level of encryption 2000 years ago, the same did not hold true for the 20th century.  Russians attempted to use the Ceasar Cipher during World War I in lieu of more sophisticated methods. This was largely because it was easier for their troops to decode messages in the field, but the same held true for German and Austrian cryptanalysts.

Take a look at this example. Use the slider to increase the offset and encrypt the text.
