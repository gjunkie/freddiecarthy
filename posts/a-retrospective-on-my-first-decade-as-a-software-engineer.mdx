I've been working in the software industry as an Engineer since 2010. Over that time I've learned a ton about software and people. I thought I'd take a little time to reflect on my career and the things I've learned, so here's a little breakdown of what my first decade in the industry has looked like.

## Beginnings (2004 - 2010)
Oh, how I wish code schools were a thing when I started learning to code...

My introduction to making websites was in around 2004 making personal blogs and fan sites. A couple of years after that I experimented with Apple's iWeb (remember that thing!?) which was fun and convenient to use as I was traveling abroad and needed something that was fast and required zero setup. This didn't last long as I soon discovered Wordpress and became an almost instant convert.

Around 2009 I realized that this is what I wanted to do for a living. I hadn't really been _learning_ much about making websites up to this point, so to do it professionally I knew I had a ton to learn. This wasn't as accessible as it is today. The vast amounts of resources available to folks right now is incredible. Granted the web was a simpler place back then, but the challenge remained. I needed to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery if I wanted to get anywhere. I spent almost two years after graduating college working retail and learning how to make websites. I applied at a start-up that I really wanted to work at three different times, each of those failing in-person tech interviews, until I finally got hired.

## Hatchling (2010 - 2015)

**The first five years of anyone's engineering career are incredibly formative years**. _Everything_ is new; the technologies you're exposed to, the ways in which people work and communicate, the tools the industry uses, how to collaborate with people, etc. As I think back on this time I think the biggest lesson I learned is that you need to surround yourself with people smarter than yourself, but they need to be empathetic and enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge. **This will greatly shape the way _you_ work in the future when you become the Senior Engineer and mentor to others**.

**The first job I had was at Demand Media**, the start-up I mentioned earlier (they're now called Leaf Group). I started there one week before the company went public which was completely wild. Having zero understanding of what startup culture was like and being thrust into it in this was certainly not how I imagined my entry into the industry. Most of the work I did there was HTML, CSS, JavaScript + jQuery, and some basic PHP.

After almost two years there **I went on to Discover Digital Networks**. I initially worked on an unreleased product built on Backbone.js, which I had no idea how to use. I was learning on the job. After the product was sold off before it even launched, **Discovery's then-recently acquired Revision3 (Diggnation anyone?) was in need of help. I worked there for another year**. This was a similar environment as my first job; lots of PHP templates, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript + jQuery.

At this point my family and I made the move to Portland, OR. Remote work wasn't as ubiquitous as it is today so I had to make another career move. A friend had started his own agency, First and Third, and he brought me on as a remote employee allowing us to make the move. During my short ~5 month stint there I got to learn quite a bit about Node.js, Hapi.js (RIP), and really just how to work as a contractor. There's a lot of nuance in time-keeping, tax reporting, etc, which I don't particularly care for. **So at this point I decided to start looking for work again and found my place at Nike** on a short-term contract where I was W-2'd ðŸŽ‰.

At Nike I worked on an internal Backbone.js platform used by the company to plan out their global initiatives. I was still very much learning how to effectively use Backbone.js, and since I hadn't used it for about a year or so it was certainly interesting having to pick it back up in this environment. The platform had recently been quickly re-written in Backbone and the responsible engineers no longer worked for the company. They also were using SVN instead of Git at that point, which I had used a couple of times in the past, but really didn't care for.

## Somehwere in the middle (2015 - 2017)
**In 2015 I started working at <a href="http://workwithopal.com" title="Opal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Opal</a> as a Frontend Engineer**. At that point my experience was largely in Backbone.js, which suited me well for this new role.

The first few years at Opal were instrumental in shaping my career. Being a smaller start-up allowed us engineers to have a great deal of ownership in the software we wrote and in the processes we implemented. If we took on more responsibility and initiative and we made a couple of attempts at modernizing the frontend codebase. First was Ember. We didn't get very far with that, mostly building out a single feature. In 2017 we decided to adopt React and I fell in love. The challenge with this was that we couldn't hit pause on feature development while we converted a massive frontend codebase to React. So we had to upgrade the car while we were driving it. This was incredibly challenging for a number of reasons (performance, state management, etc) but I learned a _ton_.

## More recently (2017 - 2020)
**In 2017, still at Opal, I was promoted to Engineering Manager** to lead a team of four engineers. This was a turning point for my career. I learned so much about a wide range of skills; technical planning & identifying KPIs/ROIs, prioritization, risk management, platform stability monitoring, cross-functional team collaboration, resource management, recruiting, onboarding, and mentoring to name a few.

In early 2020 the pandemic hit. Many people were laid off and I was faced with the question of how I could make the most impact based of our company's needs, my expertise, and how all of that could align with my own interests. **I decided to step back into engineering full time as a Senior Software Engineer**. I focused largely on frontend performance, continuing to convert our legacy codebase to React, mentoring junior engineers, and helping onboard new ones.
