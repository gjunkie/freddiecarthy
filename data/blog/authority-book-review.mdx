<p>
Authority gives us a look into the inner workings of a secretive government organization, Central, and its Southern Reach outpost as it attempts to understand what happened to previous expeditions into Area X.
</p>

<p>
Following the events of Annihilation, we get a sense of what may have happened to prior expeditions thanks to sparse evidence, disturbing video footage, and the mysterious return of a familiar expedition member.
</p>

<p>
The Southern Reach is not what it used to be. A shell of its former self lacking funding and resources, a new Director is appointed after the disappearance of its previous Director in Area X. The new director, simply known as Control, must uncover what the prior Director's true intentions were for going into Area X and learn what he can from the survivor.
</p>

<p>
Can Control trust the employees of The Southern Reach and the information they drip feed him? Does Central have other motives for sending him? What does the survivor know about Area X and the previous Director? Why is the Lighthouse so important? These questions will keep you coming back for more, and the book perfectly sets up the third book in the trilogy, Acceptance.
</p>

<p>
If you enjoyed Annihilation I recommend picking this one up.
