I recently read Digital Minimalism (review) by Cal Newport. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. Since the proliferation of the smartphone tech companies have figured out how to grab our attention with surgical precision. Our online habits have become so pervasive that we are measurably more anxious, less intentional, and they significantly degrade our interpersonal relationships. Digital Minimalism is a philosophy that aims to help you regain control of these habits and live a more meaningful and purposeful life.

Since reading it I've begun taking a careful look at the things that pull my attention away from the most important things in my life (relationships, kids, and my own sanity).

I've started employing a few simple strategies to _significantly_ cut down on time spent on digital outlets and I wanted to share them here in case you're looking for some ideas to go on a digital diet.

### Reducing digital clutter
The first thing I did, which should come as no surprise and is a primary point in Digital Minimalism, was to delete every single app from my phone that wasn't essential. Twitter, Instagram, Discord, and a number of other apps are gone. If I want to check any of those things I can do so from my computer. This ensures I never get pulled away when I should be paying attention to my kids, or get tempted when I simply want to check the weather or, heaven forbid, I'm bored for 5 seconds.

This alone was a huge catalyst for a number of habits which have started to have a compound effect in my productivity, happiness, and anxiety.

Another piece to the puzzle here was effectively eliminating all notifications. For any notifications that I still want to get I've grouped them together in a morning and evening Notification Summary on iOS. This way I'm tempted to tap on a notification if all I wanted to do was check the time.

### Reading all the time
One thing I've been doing for years is follow dozens of news sources via RSS, NY Times app, randomly surfing the web, etc. I felt I needed to check 

One thing I _didn't_ do a lot of was read books.

So I tried something... I got myself a cheap Kindle
